negative,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
negative,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
negative,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
negative,@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
negative,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
negative,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
negative,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
negative,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
negative,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
negative,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
negative,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
negative,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
negative,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
negative,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
negative,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
negative,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
negative,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
negative,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
negative,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
negative,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
negative,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
negative,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
negative,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
negative,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
negative,@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
negative,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
negative,@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
negative,@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
negative,@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
negative,"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
negative,@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
negative,@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
negative,@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
negative,"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"
negative,@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
negative,"@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?"
negative,@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
negative,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
negative,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
negative,@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
negative,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
negative,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
negative,@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
negative,@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
negative,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
negative,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
negative,@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancÃ©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
negative,@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
negative,@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
negative,"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
negative,@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
negative,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
negative,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
negative,@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
negative,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
negative,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
negative,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
negative,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
negative,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
negative,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
negative,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
negative,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
negative,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
negative,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
negative,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
negative,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
negative,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
negative,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
negative,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
negative,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
negative,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
negative,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
negative,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
negative,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
negative,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
negative,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
negative,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
negative,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
negative,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
negative,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
negative,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
negative,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
negative,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
negative,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
negative,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
negative,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
negative,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
negative,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
negative,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
negative,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
negative,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
negative,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
negative,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
negative,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
negative,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
negative,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
negative,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
negative,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
negative,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
negative,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
negative,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
negative,â€œ@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KNâ€ù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
negative,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
negative,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
negative,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
negative,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
negative,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
negative,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
negative,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
negative,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
negative,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
negative,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
negative,@united why would they make me share a room?
negative,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
negative,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
negative,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
negative,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
negative,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
negative,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
negative,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
negative,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
negative,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
negative,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
negative,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
negative,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
negative,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
negative,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
negative,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
negative,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
negative,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
negative,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
negative,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
negative,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
negative,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
negative,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
negative,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
negative,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
negative,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
negative,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
negative,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
negative,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
negative,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
negative,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
negative,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
negative,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
negative,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
negative,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
negative,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
negative,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
negative,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
negative,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
negative,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigatedâ€”my time wasted (2/2)
negative,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
negative,@united That's correctâ€”I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
negative,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
negative,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
negative,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
negative,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
negative,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
negative,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your controlâ€”the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
negative,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
negative,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
negative,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
negative,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
negative,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
negative,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
negative,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
negative,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
negative,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
negative,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your siteâ€”it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
negative,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
negative,â€œ@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JPâ€ù what's the point of membership?
negative,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
negative,@united Dmed you. Thank you
negative,"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
negative,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
negative,"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
negative,@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
negative,@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
negative,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
negative,@united where's my damn bag??
negative,@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
negative,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
negative,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
negative,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
negative,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
negative,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
negative,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
negative,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
negative,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
negative,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
negative,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
negative,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
negative,@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
negative,@united So you are inadequate by accident?
negative,@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
negative,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
negative,@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
negative,@united ...and when that doesn't work...
negative,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
negative,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
negative,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
negative,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
negative,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggageâ€_ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
negative,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
negative,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
negative,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
negative,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
negative,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
negative,@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
negative,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
negative,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
negative,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
negative,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
negative,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
negative,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
negative,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
negative,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
negative,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
negative,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
negative,@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
negative,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
negative,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
negative,@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
negative,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
negative,@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
negative,@united I did... no response back
negative,@united this is atrocious customer service.
negative,@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
negative,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
negative,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
negative,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
negative,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
negative,@united is the worst airline in the world.
negative,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
negative,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
negative,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
negative,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
negative,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
negative,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
negative,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
negative,@united I think DM would be better
negative,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
negative,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
negative,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
negative,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
negative,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
negative,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
negative,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
negative,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
negative,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
negative,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
negative,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
negative,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
negative,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
negative,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
negative,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
negative,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
negative,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley _Ÿ˜ƒ_Ÿ˜ƒ_Ÿ˜ƒ
negative,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
negative,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
negative,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
negative,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
negative,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
negative,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
negative,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
negative,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
negative,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
negative,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
negative,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
negative,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
negative,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
negative,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
negative,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
negative,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
negative,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
negative,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
negative,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
negative,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
negative,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
negative,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
negative,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
negative,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
negative,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
negative,"@united This must be a drone â€œ@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
negative,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
negative,@united flight attendant doesnâ€™t understand not understanding English doesnâ€™t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
negative,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
negative,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
negative,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents _Ÿ‘¿
negative,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
negative,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
negative,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
negative,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
negative,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
negative,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
negative,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
negative,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
negative,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
negative,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
negative,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
negative,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
negative,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
negative,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
negative,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
negative,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
negative,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
negative,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
negative,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
negative,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
negative,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
negative,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
negative,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
negative,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
negative,@united go to hell
negative,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
negative,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
negative,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
negative,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
negative,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
negative,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
negative,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
negative,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
negative,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
negative,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
negative,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
negative,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
negative,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
negative,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
negative,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
negative,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
negative,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
negative,@united already missed  connection ugh
negative,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
negative,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
negative,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.

negative,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
negative,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
negative,@united that's not even an apology
negative,@united that's cool - now what?
negative,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
negative,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
negative,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
negative,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
negative,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
negative,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
negative,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"

negative,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member _Ÿ˜”
negative,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
negative,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
negative,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
negative,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
negative,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
negative,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
negative,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.

negative,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
negative,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?

negative,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
negative,"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
negative,"@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again."
negative,"@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet"
negative,"@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
negative,@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
negative,@united literally sucks
negative,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
negative,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
negative,@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
negative,@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
negative,"@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised...."
negative,@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
negative,@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
negative,@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
negative,@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?
negative,@united you are terrible.
negative,"@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
negative,@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
negative,@united â€_ But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR
negative,"@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 â€_"
negative,@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
negative,@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
negative,@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
negative,@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
negative,@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
negative,BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
negative,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
negative,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
negative,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
negative,@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
negative,"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
negative,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
negative,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
negative,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
negative,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
negative,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
negative,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
negative,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
negative,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
negative,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
negative,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
negative,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
negative,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i donâ€™t see that it has taken off yet"
negative,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
negative,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
negative,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
negative,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
negative,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
negative,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
negative,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
negative,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
negative,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
negative,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
negative,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
negative,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
negative,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
negative,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
negative,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
negative,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
negative,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
negative,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
negative,@united it will be on a different airline.
negative,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
negative,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
negative,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
negative,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
negative,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
negative,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
negative,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
negative,@united i need help but in spanish
negative,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
negative,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
negative,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
negative,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
negative,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
negative,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
negative,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
negative,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
negative,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
negative,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
negative,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
negative,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
negative,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
negative,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
negative,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
negative,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
negative,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
negative,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
negative,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
negative,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
negative,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
negative,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
negative,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
negative,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
negative,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
negative,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
negative,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
negative,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
negative,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
negative,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
negative,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
negative,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
negative,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
negative,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
negative,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
negative,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
negative,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
negative,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
negative,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
negative,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
negative,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
negative,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
negative,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
negative,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from SÃ£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
negative,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
negative,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
negative,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
negative,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
negative,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
negative,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
negative,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
negative,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
negative,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
negative,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
negative,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
negative,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
negative,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
negative,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
negative,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
negative,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
negative,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
negative,@united lol too little too Late Flight
negative,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
negative,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
negative,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
negative,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
negative,@united your seats are god awful.
negative,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
negative,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
negative,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
negative,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
negative,@united i sure will
negative,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
negative,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
negative,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
negative,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
negative,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
negative,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
negative,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
negative,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
negative,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
negative,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
negative,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
negative,@united I need help with a missing bag.
negative,@united I was. But I have given up.
negative,@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!

negative,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
negative,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
negative,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
negative,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
negative,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
negative,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
negative,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
negative,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
negative,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
negative,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
negative,"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
negative,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
negative,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!

negative,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
negative,@united why do you hate your passengers?
negative,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
negative,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
